# BucketListing Specifics

BucketListing is a SmartTodo app which is primarily intended for mobile use. It incorperates APIS for the purpose of using key-words inserted into the ToDo and categorizing them automatically into **Eat** (refering to Restaurants of Cafés), **Read** (Books), **Watch** (Movies and Shows), and **Buy** (Shopping in general). There is also a **Miscellaneous** category which is intended as the catch-all, though it is unfotunately unused at the moment due to a lack of free shopping apis. Still, there is the functionality in the website to quickly and easily refactor a shop API in, at which point the functionality could be added.
